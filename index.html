      <p class="t2">Hi jellu,,, hope u r reading this note with a good pic of mine in the side (else  fack shravan). You were my first friends in the girl's in Amrita and the best obvi... I din get comfortable with anyone else like I did with you... I still remember all those phone calls abt being afraid of ghosts and rats, you were more like a guy than a girl 😋 I think that's why you fit so well in the grp. I am very excited for this day coz this is the first time we are celebrating ur bday... And I assure you it won't be the last 😋. Never change, stay fat and be the jelly we kno you as. 
Happy birthday Ramya</p>

      <p class="t2">Dear bonda, do you really think I need to tell you how much I love you?...If you think so, then I'm afraid there's not enough words that could help me do it....Okay, that was serious. And you know it too. There's so many things I want to tell you but I don't want to put too many biscuits in public and draw unnecessary attention to this stupid's blog...So for now, I wish you a very very very Happy Birthday :D ...You're 22 now :O...Isn't that quite a big number? Woh!! But yea, It's just a number. I'm sure you'll remain this awesome irrespective of that increasing number and I hope that you have a wonderful year and life ahead....(But yea, let's cry when we turn 30 like everyone in F.R.I.E.N.D.S do, cause that's a real big number)</p>

      <p class="t2">Its 12:00 what does that mean...it means its December 20....still not getting....today is the day when one of my very good friend was born... The four years that I spent in Amrita will probably be the best four years of my life. That is only because of all the friends I made in it and you are one of my bestest. This should probably tell how much you mean to me. I’m one of the unlucky few to call you as my best friend. We got to know each other well during 3-2 :p and now we are as close as siblings! ‘Seriously?’ Looooooots of great memories with you jelly. Our IV trip, 3rd yr Anokha, Priya convo, Allepy trip, Trivandrum trip (Chocodad requires a spl mention here :P), Convo trip, Vinu surprise trip and your to-be brother-in-law’s wedding. Though every moment spent with you was special, these are some memories that come first to my mind. Infact I sometimes wish if I could go back to our 8th sem, roaming around every day with you and Shravan. You are probably the sweetest and most caring of all the girls I know (I know very few girls so this is not exactly a compliment) and maybe that is why Ajay hangs on to you despite you being ugly and fat. Just so you know it is you who is lucky to have a guy like Juju baby and not the other way around. Many many happy returns of the day jelly. Have a great birthday :D and here’s to this year giving you more happiness than all your 22 years combined….With lots of love...Your lil bro,...Dheeru maams

You have been a significant part of my life for the last four years and I am ever grateful for that. You have always patiently been there for me, waiting for me to take in whatever you have adviced me against and always waited for me to come back to my senses :p . You are the only one of few people who really know me in and out and yes! ,you are the most compassionate selfless lil jelly I have!

Happiest birthday rummy. You know how much I love you :* and I look forward for you joining for ms this year and telling me all about your success stories :D
Enjoy your day. Love you loads

      <p class="t2">hi ramya..one of the funniest people ive ever met. i still remember the prank call :D. you used to make fun of everyone around you but got roasted back even more. lol . but apart from that you have always been very nice and sweet . very helpful also . u have also done few seemingly impossible things like making ajay a 9 pointer . lol even he could'nt believe it when it happened and we all got convinced that it was only because of you . and i also remember how u were able to manipulate everyone while playing mafia . only i knew you were the main culprit but no one else was able to find out . _/\_ . and during the time when we all got drunk :D:D .u have no idea how high you were :P.  So continue being like this . Happy birthday .Be funny, cheerful as always and have a great year ahead  xD.

The makeup queen.. 😝 I hav a feeling u wud one day start a parlour of ur own.. The saddest part is tat I have never ever seen cry or u being sad, maybe it's cuz I wasn't close or maybe u r strong to hide Ur feelings inside. But I just hope u be happy like how I see you always.. Wish u many more happy happy returns.. May God bless you and not let u get any fatter..</p>

Where do I begin with remyyaa? 


4 years of college life where we hardly knew each other or the training days at renesas or our gym scenes or the every-Friday question Do I look faatt? :P or our endless gossips at neyyar or our unforgettable pranks on gorla which we failed everytym or the night out in bikee .. nd so much more... been just 4 months but had a greaat tym together! You're such an amazinngg person and one of the few I would never wanna miss in my life.. happy-go-lucky supper high all daay! I've always looked up to you for the kind of determination you have... to finish up things that you start with :P :D nd Food foood..the amount of craze you have jus like me.. eat moreee nd get fatterr alpum :P

      <p class="t2">Yo Ramya. Perhaps you never knew me before :P. I did not know you too, not much. At first I thought you were a show off ,a heavy one with your hair colouring, make up and stuff. But it was only after meeting you up close in thiruvananthapuram that I knew I was wrong( Yeah, you had tonsured your head, that might have contributed to that) ;ok not completely wrong either. To be fair, you are a very sweet person and the most intriguing part being the effortlessness with which you double cross people :P. You have a great caring attitude which I really appreciate. I honestly believe you are one person who could challenge my eating skills considering the tenacity with which you gobble up food on others plates. Your sense of humour is quite good, got to admit that. On this special occassion of your happy birthday, I heartily wish you a happy birthday. Happy birthday! :D Have a great and joyous year ahead and may your wishes be fulfilled!!!! Keep your cheerfullness up and enjoy!!</p>

      <p class="t2">So this is for the most charming and vibrant person I have met till date. Ramaya aka Ramu! There are a gazillion things I just love about you . The most important of all being that you don’t turn on the light and sleep at nights :’( !! Ok jk! I just love how positive you can be about any situation. I try to learn something from a relationship always and the biggest take from yours is how you can look at the positive side around any situation . 
I love how we stalk guys and GOSSIP!! Admit it .. That really got us bonding :p And your constant motivational talks to encourage me to atleast get a whiff of the GRE book on which the termites were crawling.. I love how you get paranoid about those eggs :p and how you act like Van Helsing the cockroach slayer when internally you are as disgusted as me :p :p  And most of all how caring you are towards someone sick..Even if it means cutting ajay’s disgusting toe nails :D 
But there is  one thing I just HATE about you.. You believe that you are FAT!! You are not a)Fat b)Overall Fat.. You curvy baby :p :p So yeah a very very very Happy Birthday.. Stay happy and flexible :p Love you loads..
P.S: My most important and biggest advice to you would be peases take an update before you work on something !!   :D :D

      <p class="t2">Oie Kara kolambu, Happy birthday🎁.
Din talk to u much in college. But still after coming to tvm, there is no choice. It's very nice that I atleast did that here. Otherwise I would have missed to collect memories with a person who thinks she is fat, especially while eating and still continues to do so. A very good Person at heart and that will keep u fly high. Anyway waiting for a better karakolambu style with ur new hair. Once again HAPPY B'DAY to the only make up queen I know. Wish u get whatever u wished for in the forthcoming year. </p>
